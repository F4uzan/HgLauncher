## Hubby Launcher

Hubby Launcher is a launcher with a design philosophy of 'if it works, it works.' Consisting of simply a scrolling list of apps, there is very little visual cue to disturb you. If all you want in a launcher is for it to just launch apps _ASAP_, then you may be looking at the right launcher.
