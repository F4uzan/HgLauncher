## Hubby Launcher ##

Hubby (Wubby Dubby) Launcher is a self-made launcher with no interesting feature, it's just a scrollable list of clickable icon, nothing more nothing less (I probably have more, but not now). In its current state, nothing is sorted in an order. It's practically launcher for ubergrandma.

### Why (does it exist) ? ###

The launcher itself is made as a joke, since most launcher exist on an immersive view (with wallpaper filling the screen and tiny icon floating in harmony), then there's this little rebel I made to proof that... well... bad programming with bad idea equals bad result.

### What (makes it different from other launcher) ? ###

* No nonsense, just a list of your apps
* Makes you look kewl
* Probably also has a side effect of making you look weird

### How (can I contribute) ? ###

* Send me a pull request
* Let me review the changes (but mostly I just let it go through)
* Enjoy your life

### Who (made this) ? ###

* Mostly me, I guess
* There's several picked codes from StackOverflow that sits around in my HDD, I don't know the exact author, but if you're one of them, just contact me and don't sue me please

### When (will this be updated) ? ###

There's no absolute reason for me to update this (apart from SDK update, maybe), this launcher is just a conceptual demo to see how well a launcher would've performed if it were put in same place as a regular app. You **can** however, fork this project and develop it yourself (that is, if you want to deal with my badly coded app).
